# **Chapter 1: Your First API Request ‚Äì *Getting Books from the Library API***  

In this step of my Postman journey, I learned how to make my **first API request** to retrieve all books in a library catalog. Here's how it unfolded:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:
1. **HTTP Methods**:  
   - The API documentation taught me that HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are like verbs that define the type of action I want to perform.  
   - In this case, I used **GET** because I was retrieving data.  

2. **Request URL**:  
   - A URL includes:
     - **Protocol**: `https://`
     - **Host**: `library-api.postmanlabs.com`
     - **Path**: `/books`  

3. **Response Status Codes**:  
   - I encountered a **200 OK** status code, meaning my request was successful.  
   - I also learned about other status codes like 4xx (client errors) and 5xx (server errors).  

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:  
- I created a new request in Postman:  
  - **Method**: GET  
  - **URL**: `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`  
- I sent the request and received a response containing a **JSON array of book objects**.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:  
- APIs are built around conventions, but **reading the documentation** is key to understanding how to use them.  
- Postman makes it easy to interact with APIs and view responses in real-time.  

This chapter felt like opening a treasure chest of information‚Äîmy first API request! üöÄ

# **Chapter 2: Request Parameters ‚Äì *Using Query Parameters to Filter Results***  
## Variables in Postman

In this step, I learned about **query parameters** and how they allow us to refine API requests by adding filters or extra data. Here's what I did:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:
1. **What are Query Parameters?**  
   - Query parameters are **key-value pairs** added to the end of the request URL.  
   - Syntax:  
     ```
     <base_url>?<key1>=<value1>&<key2>=<value2>
     ```
   - They allow for dynamic filtering, as seen in:  
     ```
     GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape&size=500x400
     ```

2. **Practical Example**:  
   - A Google search query like `q=postman` in the URL:  
     ```
     https://www.google.com/search?q=postman
     ```
     uses a query parameter (`q`) to return results for "Postman."

3. **When to Use Query Parameters**:
   - To filter, sort, or add optional data to responses.
   - Reading the **API documentation** is key to understanding which parameters are available.

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:
1. **Filtered Fiction Books**:  
   - I duplicated the `get books` request in Postman, renamed it `get fiction books`, and added a query parameter:  
     - **Key**: `genre`  
     - **Value**: `fiction`  
   - Postman updated the request URL automatically:  
     ```
     https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books?genre=fiction
     ```

2. **Sent the Request**:
   - I clicked **Send** and received a **200 OK** response with an array of books, but this time, only those in the "fiction" genre.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:
- **Query Parameters** are a powerful way to customize API requests.  
- Postman‚Äôs **Params tab** makes it easy to add and manage query parameters visually.
- This exercise emphasized the importance of **API documentation** in discovering parameter options.  

Filtering data by genre was like flipping through the pages of a library catalog to find the exact shelf I needed. Onward to the next chapter! üìö‚ú®

# **Chapter 3: Sending Data with POST ‚Äì *Adding a Book to the Library***  

This chapter introduced me to the **POST** method, which allows us to send data to an API. My task was to add a new book to the library by sending structured data in the request body. Here's what I learned and did:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:  
1. **What is the Body?**  
   - The **Body** is used to send structured data (e.g., JSON) with requests to create or update resources.  
   - It is commonly used with **POST**, **PUT**, and **PATCH** methods.  

![Screenshot (234)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc66a6e8-0ccb-4486-9f9d-67dbf9414970)
![Screenshot (235)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72638642-2c8b-4426-80a7-166d15019d0f)

2. **JSON Format for Body Data**:  
   - The data must be structured in **key-value pairs** like this:  
     ```json
     {
     "title": "What is Time ??",
     "author": "Akashdip Mahapatra",
     "genre": "Physics",
     "yearPublished": 2024
      }
     ```
     
![Screenshot (236)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/254af363-f430-4f87-8bda-94f6bf8d05a2)

3. **Using Postman's Body Tab**:  
   - Select the **Body** tab in Postman.  
   - Choose **raw** as the data format and set the type to **JSON** for syntax highlighting.  

4. **API Key Authorization**:  
   - Learned about the importance of including an **api-key** in the headers for authorization to avoid a `401 Unauthorized` error.  

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:  
1. **Created the "add book" Request**:  
   - **Method**: POST  
   - **URL**: `{{baseUrl}}/books`  
   - **Body**: Added the book data in JSON format.  

2. **Sent the Request**:  
   - Initially received a **401 Unauthorized** response.  
   - This error taught me that APIs often require authentication to ensure secure access.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:  
- POST requests allow us to **create new resources** by sending data in the request body.  
- Structured data like JSON is essential for adding information in a format that APIs can understand.  
- Errors like **401 Unauthorized** highlight the need for proper **authentication**, which I'll address in the next lesson.  

This chapter felt like adding a personal favorite book to the shelves of an ever-growing library‚Äîwhat an exciting moment! üìñ‚ú®

# **Chapter 4: Introduction to Variables and Scripting ‚Äì *Logging Data from the API***  

In this chapter, I learned how to use **JavaScript scripting** within Postman to interact with API responses. Here's what I did and learned:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:  

1. **JavaScript Basics in Postman**:  
   - **Logging data**:  
     - Used `console.log()` to print data to the console:  
       ```javascript
       console.log("Hello world!")
       ```  
   - **Comments**: Added explanations in the script to make it readable:  
     ```javascript
     // This is a single-line comment  
     /* This is a  
        multi-line comment */
     ```  

2. **Postman Scripting Environment**:  
   - Postman allows us to write scripts in the **Pre-request** and **Post-response (Tests)** tabs for automation and response handling.  

3. **Using `pm` Object**:  
   - `pm` is a global Postman object that provides functions to interact with requests and responses.  
   - For example:  
     ```javascript
     console.log(pm.response.json())
     ```  
     This extracts and logs the response JSON from the API.  

4. **Postman Console**:  
   - Located in the lower-left corner, it allows viewing logs, errors, and raw request-response cycles.  

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:  

1. **Updated the "add a book" Request**:  
   - Changed the body data to add a new book:  
     ```json
     {
       "title": "The Great Gatsby",
       "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
       "genre": "fiction",
       "yearPublished": 1925
     }
     ```  

2. **Added a Script**:  
   - Opened the **Tests tab** and wrote a script to log the API response:  
     ```javascript
     console.log(pm.response.json())
     ```  

3. **Sent the Request**:  
   - Observed the new book being added successfully.  
   - Opened the **Postman Console** to view the JSON response logged by the script.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:  
- **Scripts in Postman** enhance automation by processing data dynamically.  
- Logging with `console.log()` is a powerful way to debug and inspect API responses.  
- Postman Console is a great tool for tracking request and script execution.  

It was rewarding to see how we could capture data programmatically‚Äîlike being the librarian who documents each new arrival in the library! üìö‚ú®

![Screenshot (244)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82ab7577-ed59-4caf-a0a2-d3ad17ee1440)

---

### **Response Details**  
- **ID**: `04cd01e2-29ee-42f2-93b3-c41c0e71bb90`  
- **Title**: `"What is Time ??"`  
- **Author**: `"Akashdip Mahapatra"`  
- **Genre**: `"Physics"`  
- **Year Published**: `2024`  
- **Checked Out**: `false` (The book is not checked out yet.)  
- **Permanent Collection**: `false` (It's not part of a permanent collection.)  
- **Created At**: `"2024-11-19T22:34:49.814Z"` (Date and time when the book was added.)  

---

### üéØ **Achievement**  
- **HTTP Status Code**: `201 Created`  
  - Indicates that the book was successfully added to the library database.  
- The server returned all the details of the newly created book entry, including a unique `id` to reference this book in future requests.

---

### üìò **Next Steps**  
- Use this `id` in future operations, like retrieving, updating, or deleting this specific book.  
- Continue exploring how Postman handles variables and scripting for automating these tasks! üòä

---
---

Here‚Äôs a summary of how you can **grab the new book ID** and save it as a variable:

---

### **Steps to Save the Book ID as a Collection Variable**
1. **Change the Book Details in the Body Tab**  
   - Go to the **Body tab** of the "add a book" request.  
   - Replace the book details with information about a new book you'd like to add.

   Example JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "The Mysteries of Space",
     "author": "Akashdip Mahapatra",
     "genre": "Astronomy",
     "yearPublished": 2024
   }
   ```

2. **Add the Script to Save the Book ID**  
   - Open the **Post-response tab** in the **Scripts section** of the "add a book" request.  
   - Replace the `console.log()` statement with the following code:
     ```javascript
     // Save the "id" value from the response to a local variable named "id"
     const id = pm.response.json().id;

     // Save the "id" as a collection variable named "id"
     pm.collectionVariables.set("id", id);
     ```
![Screenshot (245)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34af0bfa-306c-4db0-9c9a-1ded9c872fe2)

3. **Save and Send the Request**  
   - Save your changes.  
   - Click **Send** to execute the request.

![Screenshot (246)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4dcb739-0b08-42ff-bc80-80c7e289b370)

4. **Verify the Variable is Set**  
   - After the request completes successfully (with a `201 Created` status), the script will run, saving the book‚Äôs `id` into a collection variable.  
   - To confirm:
     - Click your **Postman Library API v2 collection**.
     - Go to the **Variables tab**.
     - Look for a variable named `id` under **Current Value**. Its value should match the `id` from the response.

---

### **Example of How the ID Variable Works**
You can now use `{{id}}` in subsequent requests within the same collection. For example:
- To retrieve the book by ID:  
  **GET** `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/{{id}}`

### Steps to Delete a Book Using the DELETE Method

1. **Create the "delete a book" Request**  
   - In your **Postman Library API v2** collection:  
     - Hover over the collection name, click the **three dots**, and select **Add Request**.  
     - Name the new request **"delete a book"**.

2. **Configure the DELETE Request**  
   - **Request Method**: Set to **DELETE**.  
   - **Request URL**: Enter:  
     ```text
     {{baseUrl}}/books/:id
     ```  
   - Replace `:id` with `{{id}}`. This uses the `id` collection variable dynamically set during the "add a book" request.

3. **Check Path Variable**  
   - In the **Params** tab, ensure the `id` path variable is set to `{{id}}`.

4. **Save and Send the Request**  
   - Click **Save** to save the request.  
   - Hit **Send** to delete the book.  

5. **Verify the Response**  
   - A **204 No Content** status code indicates the server successfully deleted the book.  
   - No response body is expected.

6. **Test If the Book Is Really Deleted**  
   - Without making any changes, **Send the DELETE request again**.  
   - You will get a **404 Not Found** status code.  
   - This confirms that the book no longer exists in the database.
