# **Chapter 1: Your First API Request ‚Äì *Getting Books from the Library API***  

In this step of my Postman journey, I learned how to make my **first API request** to retrieve all books in a library catalog. Here's how it unfolded:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:
1. **HTTP Methods**:  
   - The API documentation taught me that HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are like verbs that define the type of action I want to perform.  
   - In this case, I used **GET** because I was retrieving data.  

2. **Request URL**:  
   - A URL includes:
     - **Protocol**: `https://`
     - **Host**: `library-api.postmanlabs.com`
     - **Path**: `/books`  

3. **Response Status Codes**:  
   - I encountered a **200 OK** status code, meaning my request was successful.  
   - I also learned about other status codes like 4xx (client errors) and 5xx (server errors).  

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:  
- I created a new request in Postman:  
  - **Method**: GET  
  - **URL**: `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`  
- I sent the request and received a response containing a **JSON array of book objects**.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:  
- APIs are built around conventions, but **reading the documentation** is key to understanding how to use them.  
- Postman makes it easy to interact with APIs and view responses in real-time.  

This chapter felt like opening a treasure chest of information‚Äîmy first API request! üöÄ

### Steps to Make Your First API Request: **Get Books**

#### **1. Add a New Request**
1. Open Postman.
2. Inside your Collection:
   - Click **"Add a request"**.
   - Alternatively, hover over the Collection name, click the three dots (**‚ãÆ**), and select **"Add request"**.
3. **Name the Request**:
   - Enter the name **"get books"**.

#### **2. Configure the Request**
1. Set the **Request Method**:
   - Use the dropdown near the request name to select **GET**.
2. Enter the **Request URL**:
   - Paste the URL:  
     **`https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`**.

#### **3. Save Your Work**
1. Use the shortcut:
   - Windows: **Ctrl + S**.
   - Mac: **Command + S**.

#### **4. Send the Request**
1. Click the **Send** button (usually in blue).
2. Observe the Response Section:
   - Check the bottom half of Postman for the response.

---

### **Interpreting the Response**
- The response will be in **JSON format** and include an **array of book objects**.  
   Example:
   ```json
   [
       { "id": 1, "title": "Book Title 1", "author": "Author Name" },
       { "id": 2, "title": "Book Title 2", "author": "Author Name" }
   ]
   ```
- Note: The content might differ due to real-time updates by other users.

---

### **Key Concepts: HTTP Request Components**
#### **1. Request Method**
- **GET**: Retrieve data.
- Other Methods:
  - **POST**: Create data.
  - **PUT/PATCH**: Update data.
  - **DELETE**: Remove data.

#### **2. Request URL**
- Structure: **`<protocol>://<host>/<path>`**
  - Protocol: **https://**
  - Host: **library-api.postmanlabs.com**
  - Path: **/books**
- This forms the endpoint: **`https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`**

#### **3. Response Status Codes**
- **200 OK**: Successful response.
- Other Common Status Codes:
  - **201 Created**: New resource created.
  - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request format.
  - **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or incorrect credentials.
  - **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn‚Äôt exist.
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: Server issue.

### **Summary Table: Request Configuration**
| Field            | Value                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Method**        | GET                                                |
| **URL**           | https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books          |
| **Expected Status** | 200 OK                                           |
| **Response Format** | JSON                                             | 

**Congratulations!** You‚Äôve successfully retrieved a list of books using an API request. üéâ

# **Chapter 2: Request Parameters ‚Äì *Using Query Parameters to Filter Results***  
## Variables in Postman

In this step, I learned about **query parameters** and how they allow us to refine API requests by adding filters or extra data. Here's what I did:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:
1. **What are Query Parameters?**  
   - Query parameters are **key-value pairs** added to the end of the request URL.  
   - Syntax:  
     ```
     <base_url>?<key1>=<value1>&<key2>=<value2>
     ```
   - They allow for dynamic filtering, as seen in:  
     ```
     GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape&size=500x400
     ```

2. **Practical Example**:  
   - A Google search query like `q=postman` in the URL:  
     ```
     https://www.google.com/search?q=postman
     ```
     uses a query parameter (`q`) to return results for "Postman."

3. **When to Use Query Parameters**:
   - To filter, sort, or add optional data to responses.
   - Reading the **API documentation** is key to understanding which parameters are available.

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:
1. **Filtered Fiction Books**:  
   - I duplicated the `get books` request in Postman, renamed it `get fiction books`, and added a query parameter:  
     - **Key**: `genre`  
     - **Value**: `fiction`  
   - Postman updated the request URL automatically:  
     ```
     https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books?genre=fiction
     ```

2. **Sent the Request**:
   - I clicked **Send** and received a **200 OK** response with an array of books, but this time, only those in the "fiction" genre.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:
- **Query Parameters** are a powerful way to customize API requests.  
- Postman‚Äôs **Params tab** makes it easy to add and manage query parameters visually.
- This exercise emphasized the importance of **API documentation** in discovering parameter options.  

Filtering data by genre was like flipping through the pages of a library catalog to find the exact shelf I needed. Onward to the next chapter! üìö‚ú®

# **Chapter 3: Sending Data with POST ‚Äì *Adding a Book to the Library***  

This chapter introduced me to the **POST** method, which allows us to send data to an API. My task was to add a new book to the library by sending structured data in the request body. Here's what I learned and did:  

---

### üåü **What I Learned**:  
1. **What is the Body?**  
   - The **Body** is used to send structured data (e.g., JSON) with requests to create or update resources.  
   - It is commonly used with **POST**, **PUT**, and **PATCH** methods.  

![Screenshot (234)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc66a6e8-0ccb-4486-9f9d-67dbf9414970)
![Screenshot (235)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72638642-2c8b-4426-80a7-166d15019d0f)

2. **JSON Format for Body Data**:  
   - The data must be structured in **key-value pairs** like this:  
     ```json
     {
     "title": "What is Time ??",
     "author": "Akashdip Mahapatra",
     "genre": "Physics",
     "yearPublished": 2024
      }
     ```

3. **Using Postman's Body Tab**:  
   - Select the **Body** tab in Postman.  
   - Choose **raw** as the data format and set the type to **JSON** for syntax highlighting.  

4. **API Key Authorization**:  
   - Learned about the importance of including an **api-key** in the headers for authorization to avoid a `401 Unauthorized` error.  

---

### üõ† **Task Completed**:  
1. **Created the "add book" Request**:  
   - **Method**: POST  
   - **URL**: `{{baseUrl}}/books`  
   - **Body**: Added the book data in JSON format.  

2. **Sent the Request**:  
   - Initially received a **401 Unauthorized** response.  
   - This error taught me that APIs often require authentication to ensure secure access.  

---

### üìù **Takeaways**:  
- POST requests allow us to **create new resources** by sending data in the request body.  
- Structured data like JSON is essential for adding information in a format that APIs can understand.  
- Errors like **401 Unauthorized** highlight the need for proper **authentication**, which I'll address in the next lesson.  

This chapter felt like adding a personal favorite book to the shelves of an ever-growing library‚Äîwhat an exciting moment! üìñ‚ú®
